# ComputerProject_MAI391 - Linear Regression (+ Polynomial Regression) from scratch
The computer project of MAI391 where we deal with the problems of basic Machine Learning.
In this project, we decided to build the Linear Regression algorithm (and by extension, Polynomial Regression) from literally nothing, which means no relying on the sklearn library.
There is a demo on a dataset with D > 1 features for Linear Regression and D = 1 for Polynomial Regression
